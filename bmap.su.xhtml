Fibre that makes you laugh! LOL
To qualify into this list, the provider must employ fibre, yet offer the same (or slower) speeds over fibre as what would have been offered over xDSL.

18/1.5 @ 53 -- AT&amp;T U-verse FTTP (24/3 @ 63 is only available through copper)
att.com/u-verse

Unclear offerings, 25/7.0 mixed network w/ FTTN DSL and FTTP; extra bonus for ridiculous caps; offered in major cities in Ontario and Quebec.
fibe.bell.ca


====
Copper which is faster than AT&amp;T fibre.
To qualify, the provider must offer uncapped ADSL2/VDSL2, with the option of pair bonding, or competitive VDSL2.

20/1 @ 39 (1 twisted pair with free PSTN)
40/2 @ 69 (bonded pair with 2 free PSTN)
http://sonic.net/solutions/home/internet/fusion/

40/20 @ ~35 and down and up; various locations

====
Not fibre, but uber fast.

45/45 or 100/100 or 200/200 @ 45,00 in San Francisco, CA and Oakland, CA
Webpass uses wireless-to-the-building model, so YMMV.  Some users report outages, but mostly positive reviews.
